This is data from the "AInix Kernel Dataset (Archie Release)". The data was exported from https://github.com/AInixProject/AInix 90d23da97e3a which is more nicely formatted for editing as yaml files. However, wanted to make a version that is json to be more compatible with the NLC2CMD challenge (http://nlc2cmd.us-east.mybluemix.net/).

For more context about the dataset see https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/apps/tech-reports/177982
